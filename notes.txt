Node and V8 is written in C++.
Ecmascript is the standard Javascript is based on.

First-CLass functions: operations that you can do with other types can do with functions as well.

prototypal inheritance: 

Note JS doesnot simply give V8 the code to implement but it wraps it into some other code that makes all these work.

'require' is a function, that you pass a 'path' too.
module.exports is what the require function returns.

This works because your code is actually wrapped in a function that is given these things as function parameters.
WHatever we write is the body of a function.
